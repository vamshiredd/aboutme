Vamshikrishna Reddy Yedalla

Iam a graduate student perceiving masters in the field of Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.Iam living here in off campus since a week and certainly I felt a beautiful place to study.

Coming to Undergraduate studies,I studied my Undergraduation at Vardhaman college of Engineering in the stream of Electrical and Elecronics Engineering where I got huge interset in Programming Languages like c,java etc.Moreover,I like to enjoy Watching Hollywood Adventure Movies.

Its my dream to establish a software company using the knowledge I would gain during graduate studies.

I always feel  energetic for accepting challenges and making them in favour towards myside ...that's all
